Check if Tree is Binary Search Tree
Since you already know what a binary search tree is, this challenge will establish how it is you can tell that a tree is a binary search tree or not.

The main distinction of a binary search tree is that the nodes are ordered in an organized fashion. Nodes have at most 2 child nodes (placed to the right and/or left) based on if the child node's value is greater than or equal to (right) or less than (left) the parent node.

In this challenge, you will create a utility for your tree. Write a JavaScript method isBinarySearchTree which takes a tree as an input and returns a boolean value for whether the tree is a binary search tree or not. Use recursion whenever possible.
